# UponRequest
This repository contains code to study data availability statements such as “data available upon request” in the scientific articles.

The project focuses on large scale text mining of full text articles to detect, classify, and quantify request based access practices across journals, years.

## Project goals

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Identify data availability statements relying on request based access  
- Distinguish genuine restrictions from formal or misleading formulations  
- Quantify temporal and journal specific trends  
- Support reproducibility, meta research, and policy analysis on data sharing practices  

## Scope

The analyses are based on structured full text articles, primarily JATS XML files, and rely on automated parsing and rule based pattern matching.

This repository is intended as a research and analysis codebase, not as a general purpose software library.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized into logical steps, typically including:

- Metadata collection and filtering  
- Full text parsing and extraction  
- Detection and classification of data availability language  
- Aggregation, scoring, and summary analyses  

Details about individual scripts and workflows will be added progressively.

## Status

This repository is under active development.  
The structure, scripts, and outputs may evolve as analyses are refined.

## License

This project is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Citation

If you use this code or derived analyses in academic work, citation information will be provided in a dedicated `CITATION.cff` file at a later stage.
