# XML files

This directory is used to store full text articles in JATS XML format.

It is empty in the repository because it normally contains a large number of XML files, which cannot be hosted on GitHub.

The XML files used in this project can be downloaded separately or obtained from archived datasets deposited on Zenodo.

Do not commit XML files to GitHub.
